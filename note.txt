Hi everyone,
I just asked Stephanie a couple of questions in the General meeting. 
She confirmed that for the purposes of the project, she is our client. So we are basically pretending that we have a client who wants a website about any sport. The content is completely our choice.
I also asked about the number of pages for our site. She said there is no minimum or maximum, but that we need more than one. She said we don't need excessive information and that 20 pages would be too many. So I gather from her response that between 5-10 pages would be an appropriate goal for us.
