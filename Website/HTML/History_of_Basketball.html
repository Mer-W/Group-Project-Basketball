            The game of basketball as it is known today was created by
            <a href="https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith" target="_blank">Dr. James Naismith</a>
            in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts,
            to condition young athletes during cold months.<br>

            In an attempt to increase participation in his gym class, which consisted of older 
            gentlemen training to become executive secretaries, James Naismith invented a game 
            he called “basket ball” (then two words).<br>

            Naismith's original 13 rules - complete with a hand-written line edit - now reside at the 
            University of Kansas after alumnus David Booth, who grew up in eyeshot of the campus, 
            purchased them at auction in 2010 for $4.3 million.<br>
