    <img src = "/Images/Steph Curry.jpeg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players" />
    <p id="fiba_a_specialevents">The NBA has a rich history, dating back nearly 68 years, full of decorated organizations and players. During that time, we've seen our fair share of greats come and go, but which players in the game's history stand out above the rest? To decide that, we'll look at various criteria including statistics, team success and individual accolades. Do any current superstars like Stephen Curry and LeBron James make the cut? Let's take a look at the 10 greatest players in NBA history and find out.</p>
   <h1>No.10: Stephen Curry</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/Steph_Curry.jpeg" alt="Steph Curry" />
    <p id="fiba_a_specialevents"> Shaq of point guards. While the Diesel collapsed defenses, Steph expands them, taking the 3-point philosophy of Mike D’Antoni and turning it up a couple notches. Defenses have to stay up on him full-court, which his handles and elusiveness make impossible to do. He’ll then pull-up from halfcourt and make it 43.5 percent of the time. He is, without a doubt, the greatest shooter of all time after becoming the career leader in made 3-pointers. Compared to most of the guys on this list, though, Curry was a slow starter. He had issues with his ankles early in his career forcing us to wait to see the greatness that we caught glimpses of during his time in college at Davidson. Warriors fans booed then-new owner Joe Lacob on Chris Mullin Night because he gave the team to Steph after trading fan favorite Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut. Golden State won their first championship in four decades three years later. Now he’s the first unanimous MVP in league history (which is pretty stupid, but still) and has four rings to go with another MVP. With his latest title, he finally knocked off  Finals MVP off his checklist after a dominant performance against the Boston Celtics. There’s absolutely nothing left for Steph to accomplish and that’s why he ranks in our top 10 list. We’re already seeing Steph’s impact on basketball as kids start launching from deep earlier than ever in their young careers and on the league with NBA teams putting the mid-range jumper out to pasture and fully embracing the 3-pointer. A member of the league’s 75th anniversary team, Curry is easily one of the most influential players to lace ’em up.</p> 
    <h1>No.9: Tim Duncan</h1>
    <br>
     <img src = "/Images//Tim_Duncan.jpeg" alt="Tim_Duncan" />
    
     <p id="fiba_a_specialevents"> If you know The Big Fundamental’s backstory then you know the idea that he would become one of basketball’s greatest power forwards is preposterous. Duncan grew up in the US Virgin Islands. He was a swimmer and didn’t start playing basketball until later as a teen. After four years at Wake Forest, he morphed into a generational talent that every horrible team during the 1996-97 season hoped it would land so he could single-handedly reverse their fortunes. The Spurs lucked out, drafted Timmy, and became a quasi-dynasty. NBA 75 honoree, five-time champion, three-time Finals MVP, two-time regular-season MVP, 15-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA and All-Defensive team selection later, Duncan played all 19 seasons in San Antonio and consistently put up numbers like he was a robot—with the personality, as portrayed by the media, to match. Sure, Duncan benefited greatly from playing alongside the legend David Robinson and future Hall of Famers Tony Parker, Manu Ginobli, Pau Gasol, and Kawhi Leonard. But other than potentially Leonard, Duncan will shine brighter than all the other great players who have ever played for the Spurs—and just about every other power forward in NBA history—because of how rock steady solid he was. He’s top 10 in rebounds, blocks, win shares, and defensive win shares. Yeah, injuries cut him down his last few seasons, but from his Rookie of the Year campaign during the ’97-98 season through the 2009-10 season, Duncan was good for a double-double. In 251 playoff games, he averaged 19.9 PPG and 11.0 RPG. It’s the playoff excellence that helps elevate Duncan above the more physically and athletically gifted contemporary power forwards like Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett. But it’s his quiet, dignified manner that’s earned him the most praise. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich put it best when the franchise retired Duncan’s jersey. “He’s an enigma in some ways. You think Kawhi Leonard doesn’t talk much,” Popovich said. “When Timmy first got here, it was like mental telepathy. I would say something to him and he would stare. I wasn’t sure if he was paying attention…finally I realize he understood everything I was saying. Probably agreed with half of it, but was so respectful he wouldn’t say anything until later.” After hashing things out, Pop often let Duncan have his way. Can’t argue with the results.</p>  
    <h1>No.8 : Wilt Chamberlain</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/images/8_Wilt Chamberlain.jpeg" alt="Wilt Chamberlain" />
    <p>Some of us are willing to die on the “Wilt Chamberlain Belongs on the NBA’s Mt. Rushmore” hill because nobody changed the game like Wilt the Stilt did. NO. BODY. Seriously, they made rules to try and limit his dominance since he owns records no player now or in the future will ever come close to eclipsing. Who else is going to average 50.4 PPG for a season like Wilt did in the 1961-62 season? Anybody else going to averaged 22.9 RPG during their career like Wilt did? Who will ever score 100 points in a game like Wilt did? You’re telling me somebody’s going to average more than 45.8 minutes per game like Wilt did during his 13 seasons in the NBA? And no soul will ever approach his 23,924 career rebounds. Tim Duncan, the best rebounder the game’s seen since Moses Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, finished 9,000 boards behind Chamberlain despite playing five more seasons than the legendary lothario. Haters will counter that Wilt played against a bunch of stiffs in the 60s and 70s when the idea that a 7’1” center could be the most athletic player on the court was reserved for comic books. But you can only dominate the competition in front of you and the NBA did its best to reign in The Big Dipper, who rightfully earned a spot on the NBA’s 75th anniversary squad, when opponents couldn’t. Because of Chamberlain’s domination, the league widened the lane, outlawed players rebounding missed free throws before the ball touched the rim, changed the definition of offensive goaltending, and forbade inbounds passes over the basket because it was an automatic alley-oop to Wilt every single time. Jordan may be the GOAT, and the league most definitely altered some of its laws in his wake, but MJ never altered the rule book the way Chamberlain did. </p> 
    <h1>No.7: Larry Bird</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/7_Larry Bird.jpeg" alt="Larry Bird" />
    <p>Boston’s had more than its fair share of Hall of Famers roll through the old Boston Garden, but nobody was as lethal a scorer or as clutch at the end of games like Larry Legend. A three-time champion who won three consecutive MVPs in the mid-80s, and obviously made the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, Bird knocked down daggers like it was nothing and loved ripping out the hearts of his rivals while talking some of the most underrated trash. One of the greatest What Ifs in NBA history revolves around Bird’s back that he infamously injured while paving his mother’s driveway during the summer of 1985. If Bird wasn’t Mr. DIY, it’s staggering to think what else he could’ve done since he was never quite the same after that and horribly hobbled his final few years in the league. But it didn’t stop him from averaging 24.3 PPG and 10.0 RPG for his 13 seasons. Bird filled up a box score but he was never strictly a numbers guy—he was just a winner who made ridiculous passes, had a knack for seeing everything unfold seconds before anyone else on the court, and always made the key play that either sealed the deal or keyed a game-defining run. That’s why even though he could barely get loose enough to play at the end of his final season, Bird was one of the most celebrated members of the legendary Dream Team. There was no way the greatest basketball squad ever assembled could leave off the greatest small forward the game had ever known at that point. Bird’s been supplanted by someone else on that mythical list, but the Hick from French Lick is forever a Legend.  </p> 
    <h1>No.6: Shaquille O’Neal</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/6_Shaquille O’Neal.jpeg" alt="Shaquille O’Neal" />
    <p>The. Most. Dominant. Ever. Dominant seems like the only adjective to describe Shaq’s career. Shaq, obviously a member of the NBA 75 team, is one of the most skilled bigs ever to touch a basketball and we’ve all seen the video of him cooking MJ in a one-on-one before the All-Star Game. The beauty of Shaq’s dominance is that you could know after two dribbles that he was about to hit you with a dropstep in the post, but you just weren’t going to stop it even if you knew it was coming. It was either a bucket or a foul. We may never see a 7’1”, 365-pound big that was as explosive, athletic, and quick as Shaq. He was truly a one of a kind and easily one of the most entertaining players—on and off-the-court—that the NBA has ever seen. There will never be another Shaq. </p> 
    <h1>No.5: Kobe Bryant</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/5_Kobe Bryant.jpeg" alt="Kobe Bryant" />
    <p>Let’s get this out the way first: this isn’t a reactionary decision to Kobe Bryant’s passing. I personally think it’s disrespectful to leave Kobe Bean Bryant out of the top five of any all time list. Magic and Shaq crowned Kobe as the greatest Laker ever after he retired. Shouldn’t that tell you something? We can talk about the way Kobe impacted the game and the culture of basketball but that shouldn’t even be a measurement. We see the multitude of accomplishments like NBA MVP, 5-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, 18-time All-Star, nine All-Defensive First Team selections, the now fourth leading scorer, and so on. Even with all those accomplishments people try to tear him down with advanced statistics like usage rate and efficiency. To me, that’s absolutely silly for a guy who still managed to win just as many or more titles than Bird, LeBron, Wilt, Magic, and Shaq. Did you really watch Kobe Bryant—member of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team—for 20 years and say to yourself, “Well he’s not that efficient so I don’t think he’s great as he’s portrayed”? Social media can be a blessing and a curse so please don’t buy into the nonsense that Bryant wasn’t as great as he was. RIP Mamba. </p> 
    <h1>No.4: Magic Johnson</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/4_Magic Johnson.jpeg" alt="Magic Johnson" />
    <p>When you talk about best PGs in NBA history, it would be impossible to not have Magic Johnson as No. 1. For this list, he lands at No. 4 overall and for good reason. Magic simply changed the game of basketball when he burst onto the NBA scene out of Michigan State in 1979. Just think about how incredible it is that in his first season in the league, Magic started Game 6 of the NBA Finals at center and dropped 42 points. He played all five positions in the game and led the Lakers to their first title in nearly a decade. This was just the start for Magic, who at his size, completely changed the way the basketball world looked at guards. His numbers and accolades look unreal in 2020. With five championships, three MVPs, nine-time All-NBA first team selections, and inclusion on the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, Magic had one of the best careers in league history. And the best part? Magic made the game fun—that’s what made Magic so special as a player. He and Larry Bird literally saved the league in the 80s and while they couldn’t have been more different stylistically there’s no argument whose influence on the game of basketball was greater. The captain of the “Showtime” Lakers should firmly be included on anyone’s NBA top 5 list. </p> 
    <h1>No.3: Kareem Abdul Jabbar</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar.jpeg" alt="Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar" />
    <p> The NBA’s all time leading scorer and inventor of the most lethal shot in Association history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar skyhook-ed his way to 38,387 career points. Maybe, just maybe LeBron James surpasses him in another four or five seasons, but it’s going take a herculean effort on The King’s part to supplant the greatest center ever whose longevity is practically unrivaled. You’re not supposed to win NBA Finals MVP awards 14 years apart, but Abdul-Jabbar did. He earned just about every individual honor a superstar can earn, most especially six MVPs (one more than Russell and Jordan) and he’s still the only player in league history to win an MVP despite his team not making the playoffs. Of course he made the NBA 75 squad. Splitting his time between the Bucks and Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar won three MVPs with each franchise and five of his six rings in Los Angeles. A 19-time All-Star who 15 times finished in the top 5 of the MVP voting, we’ll spare you from listing out all his accolades because you’d be scrolling this fine piece of #content for hours. All you really need to know is that Abdul-Jabbar is the greatest center and it’s not even a debate. Bill Russell might have more titles, Wilt Chamberlain might have all those untouchable records, but Abdul-Jabbar was offensively skilled in ways Russell never was and retired as the league leader in nine statistical categories thanks to an impressive staying power Chamberlain couldn’t match. Abdul-Jabbar wasn’t physically dominant the way Wilt or Shaquille O’Neal was, but his fluidity was something special for someone of his gargantuan size. All other big man bow down to The Captain. </p> 
    <h1>No.2: LeBron James</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/LeBron_James.jpeg" alt="LeBron_James" />
    <p>As someone who has LeBron James as No. 1 on their best NBA players list, this is an easy one to write. When you think of LeBron James, you think of greatness. From the first dribble he took in an NBA game up until now, he’s done nothing but live up to the massive hype that was placed on his shoulders coming out of high school in Akron, Ohio. LeBron not only matched the hype, but he exceeded it. And let’s be honest, you’re being naive if you don’t think he has a chance to take the No. 1 spot on this list when his career is over. The Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James debate will never cease, but the fact that LeBron has already made it to this level is pretty damn amazing. We could go through all the stats and the awards to prove why James should be where he is on this list, but there’s really no need. We all know what he’s done and will continue to do for at least a few more years. For me, what secured James’ spot in the conversation with MJ was his performance in 2016 when he led the Cleveland Cavaliers back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-win Golden State Warriors. In my book, that’s the single greatest achievement in NBA history and will be hard to top. From dropping 41 in back-to-back games to the block in Game 7, LeBron leveled up in 2016. A member of the league’s 75th anniversary team, he long ago reached a different plane of basketball greatness that only himself and Jordan occupy. They breath different air than the rest of us and that’s ok. Let’s not forget LeBron is only 1,326 points away from passing Kareem to become the No. 1 scorer in NBA history. The irony of it is that most of his career, LeBron has not been recognized for his scoring ability despite his numbers. LeBron’s book isn’t finished yet and he could add a few more titles along the way, but let’s not also ignore everything he’s done over his career off the court. From opening a school in his hometown to building his own media empire, LeBron has consistently done everything we’ve expected from him and then some. A true GOAT.  </p> 
    <h1>No.1: Michael jordan</h1>
   <br>
    <img src = "/Images/Michael_jordan.jpeg" alt="Michael Jordan" />
    <p>How much of an explanation do you need here? Of course Michael Jordan is No. 1. This man won three in a row, left to play baseball, then came back to win three in a row again, and then he came back one more time and was one of the oldest players to average 20 PPG and to score 40-plus in a game. The GOAT, no question. But I’m still going to remind you that he never played in a Finals Game 7 in six appearances and won a Defensive Player of the Year award (‘88) along with his five MVPs, six Finals MVPs, and was named to the NBA’s 75th anniversary team. He played at the highest level on both sides of the floor and like Bill Russell before him knew exactly what he had to do to help his team win day in and day out. Jordan never took a game off, he was a maniac for better or worse. My guy was brought to tears when he looked back at how maniacal he was towards his teammates. ESPN’s The Last Dance tried its best to encapsulate MJ’s stranglehold on the basketball world and still didn’t do it justice. No guard has ever dominated the league like he did, which helps his case when you see him on the top of everyone’s list. There will never be another Michael Jordan. The winning, the endorsements, the shoes, the legacy. He did it all and made sure you knew about it along the way. All with a smile on his face and a cigar about to be lit.  </p>

        <h1>5. Tristan Thompson </h1>
        <img src = "/Images/Tristan Thompson.jpeg" alt="Tristan Thompson" />
        <p>Tristan Thompson joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2011 and went onto be voted to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 2012.

        <h1>4. Bill Wennington</h1>
        <img src = "/Images/Bill Wennington.jpeg" alt="Bill Wennington" />
        <p><You may scoff at Bill Wennington being listed as one of the best Canadian NBA players of all-time, but just look at his resume with the Chicago Bulls. The 7ft center only averaged 4.6 points per game in 720 career NBA games; but still, he won three NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls playing a key role in their championship victories. Impressively, Wennington's NBA career was practically over before joining the Bulls as he played the previous two seasons in Italy after his first NBA run ended.</p>
        <h1>3. Andrew Wiggins</h1>
        <img src = "/Images/Andrew Wiggins.jpeg" alt="Andrew Wiggins" />
        <p>Small forward Andrew Wiggins is just 24-years old and six seasons into his NBA career. Despite playing just a handful years in the Association, Wiggins is already considered one of the best Canadian NBA players of all-time. Wiggins has a career points per game average of 19.7, 4.3 rebounds, and 2.2 assists. He could move to a title contender soon and move up this list.</p>
        <h1>2. Rick Fox</h1>
        <img src = "/Images/Rick Fox.jpg" alt="Rick Fox" />
        <p>Rick Fox is an overlooked former NBA superstar today. However, he was once a highly sought-after NBA player teams coveted. Fox was a member of the Los Angeles Lakers team that won three straight NBA titles in the early 2000s. Although he was a big star and player for the Lakers, his best seasons previously came with the Boston Celtics. Fox only tallied a carry average of 9.6 points per game, but what he did on the court defensively was worth more than points.</p>
        <h1>1. Steve Nash</h1>
        <img src = "/Images/1_steve-nash.jpg" alt="Steve Nash" />
        <p>Guard Steve Nash played 1,217 NBA games with the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, and Los Angeles Lakers during an 18-year career. Nash is one of the greatest point guards to ever play in the NBA. He won two NBA MVP awards but never an NBA title. Had he won an NBA title during his illustrious career, he would most likely be considered one of the best all-time of any country of origin.</p>
